            <p>Soaked raisins are more effective and nutritional than dry raisins. When raisins are soaked then the vitamins and minerals present on the outer skin get dissolved in the water. Thus, the nutrients that we gain from raisins increases. Soaked raisins are especially beneficial for people who have high blood pressure issues.</p>
